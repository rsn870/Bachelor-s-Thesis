# Bachelor's Thesis
Hosting a pdf version of my bachelor's thesis which involved generating videos that are in sync with a given audio segment. This involved a novel architecture trained on top of the latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN (FFHQ). The details are in the pdf of the thesis and a set of slides that I presented during my viva.
